    Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal, a historic palace in Madurai, India, was built by King Thirumalai Nayakkar in the 17th century as part of his royal residence. The palace showcases the Indo-Saracenic architectural style, a blend of traditional Indian, Islamic, and European elements. Spread over 4 acres and surrounded by a moat, the palace has four wings with separate courtyards, and the most impressive part is the central hall, Swarga Vilasam, which has a two-storeyed dome-shaped roof made of granite. The walls are decorated with intricate frescoes and paintings depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, and natural light filters through the latticework on the windows. The palace also has a beautiful garden, Meenakshi Amman Temple Garden, adjacent to the temple. The palace is a protected monument maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and is open to visitors to explore and learn about Madurai's rich cultural heritage.
