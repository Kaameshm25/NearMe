    Teppakulam, a man-made lake in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, was built by the Nayak dynasty during the 17th century. Spread over 12 hectares, the lake is surrounded by lush greenery and is a peaceful and scenic spot for locals and tourists alike. The crystal-clear water allows one to see the lake bed from the surface. The lake is home to various aquatic life such as fish, turtles, and waterfowl. The area around the lake is dotted with temples and shrines, including the Teppakulam Nayak Palace, now a heritage site. This palace, built by the Nayak dynasty, served as a royal residence. Today, it houses a museum showcasing the region's history and culture. During the annual Chithirai Festival in April, the lake is illuminated with thousands of colorful lamps, creating a mesmerizing sight. Teppakulam's serene beauty, cultural significance, and rich history make it a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to Madurai.
